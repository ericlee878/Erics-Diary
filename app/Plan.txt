Things to think about:
1. Name of this app: Remindiary
2. Come up icon design:

Homework 7/2:
1. Add Header to show what Month it is.
2. When Calendar date is clicked, open up a Diary activity. When creating a new activity, make sure to pass the data around the Date, Month, Year to the next activity

3. Diary page should allow user put "What did you do?" and "How was your overall feelings?". It should also allow user to insert images for that day.
